<h2> About the albums</h2>
	<p> The albums in TxT follow a story line and continues to build throughout the years. TXT's storyline, often referred to as "The Star Seekers," centers around a group of young boys navigating the complexities of adolescence and finding their place in the world, often facing challenges and uncertainties while seeking their own unique "star" or dream, all within a multi-verse setting where they connect and support each other through their shared experiences
	
<ul>
	  <li> The narratives focus on the struggles and emotions of growing up, including friendship, first love, self-discovery, and anxieties.</li>
	  <li>TXT's universe is often depicted as having multiple realities or timelines, allowing for diverse storytelling and character development.</li>
	  <li> "Stars" represent personal dreams, aspirations, and the guiding light that helps the boys navigate their journey. </li>
	</ul>	</p>
